# Local Tune

This web app lets the user add songs to his/her pre-existing Spotify playlist or a new playlist and records the location at which the song was added. It also autodetects the song being played near the device's microphone. The interface entails a simple map, as well as buttons to start detecting a song and add a song to a playlist.
